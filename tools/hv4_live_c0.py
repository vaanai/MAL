"""hv4_live_c0: the compiled DEC-032 C0 canary limits, stake rule and fee pin for an HV4 arm on `tools/arena_live_bridge`. PR 1 of the HV4 live adapter.

Pure functions and constants. No network, no key, no file read, no HV4 ledger. Installs nothing. The limits are CODE CONSTANTS: a config may only
restate or tighten them (`config_refusal`), never loosen. Scope doc: ARTIFACTS/lab/c0-readiness-2026-10-25.md section 7, items 1 to 3.

Arms: only F or X arms are canary candidates (the L arms rewrite their playbook nightly = a prompt change = a new bot_id under DEC-032 s1.4). A bot_id
ending in -L, -P or -R is refused.

Stake: C0 stake S = min(card stake, 0.05 SOL) regardless of the HV4 size (0.25 / 0.5 / 1.0 in `hv4_arms.SIZES`, which are SOL stakes on the paper card).
The paper twin is priced at the same S.

Fee: the pin is the compiled default 55,000 buy / 55,000 sell / 150,000 escalated priority (manager decision 2026-10-25: C0 uses the default, not
p155; it equals h5_executor.H5_DEFAULT and a test asserts that). A config naming any other fee is refused.
